# Pandas-Challenge

# PyCity Schools 

# Intorduction
In this project we are going to analyze twho csv files, that contain school and student data, with this we are going to sumarize with different 
parameters the averages that the students have in different condition per school, like budget, spendig sumary per student and the school size.

# Files
In this repository you will find the PyCity_Schools.jpynb, the Resources folder and the Analysis folder. In the resources folder yoy will find
the two csv files school_complete.csv and student_complete.csv, and in the Analysis Folder you will find all the written Analysis from the data 
we obtain.

# Installation 
For reading the .jpynb file you need to open it with Jupyter Notebook, the csv file you need Excel to read the complete Data, and a text editor 
to open the written Analysis. 

# Usage 
With this project and the correct data, you can know the number of schools, the number of students, the number of students per school, the total
budget, the averages of subjects, and can alayze what are the best averges per school, knowing their size and their budget, to obtain Dataframes 
for visualize better the obtain data. 

# Results
With this project we obatin the following results: 
We analyze 15 Schools with 39,170 Yotal Students, and a Total Budget of $24,649,428.00

The schools with less spending rate (Per Student) have the best average math and reading scores, and have the best percentage of passing math
and reading, also the best percentage overall passing, and the school with more spending rate (Per Student) have the worst average for math and
reading, and have the worst percentage of passing math and reading, also the worst percentage overall passing. 

![PyCity Schools SS3](https://github.com/patricioaugusto-patinoespana/Pandas-Challenge/assets/139070248/d4cf0e00-2af8-48b5-849e-c1c6601a4940)

The schools that are samll, have the best average math and reading scores, and have the best percentage of passing math and reading, also 
the best percentage overall passing, and the school that are large have the worst average for math and reading, and have the worst percentage 
of passing math and reading, also the worst percentage overall passing. 

![PyCity Schools SS4](https://github.com/patricioaugusto-patinoespana/Pandas-Challenge/assets/139070248/67df0c17-310d-4e01-9af8-ec39dc4065f2)

The schools that are Charter, have the best average math and reading scores, and have the best percentage of passing math and reading, also 
the best percentage overall passing, and the school that are District have the worst average for math and reading, and have the worst percentage 
of passing math and reading, also the worst percentage overall passing.

So with this analysis we can conclude that:

The best scores obtain by the students are for the schools that:
-	Have the less budget 
-	Have the less budget per capita
-	Have the less spending rate per student 
-	Have small size 
-	 Are Charter’s School

The worst scores obtain by the students are for the schools that:
-	Have more budget
-	Have more budget per capita
-	Have more spending rate per student 
-	Have large size
-	Are District School’s

# Best Schools

- Thomas High School
- Cabera High School

# Worst Schools
- Huang High School
- Ford High School
